# Smolagents Hierarchical Agent Architecture

## Overview

This knowledge management system now implements a **hierarchical agent architecture** following smolagents best practices, inspired by the [deep research example](https://github.com/huggingface/smolagents/blob/main/examples/open_deep_research/run.py).

## Directory Structure Configuration

### Custom Directory Support

The Knowledge Agent now supports custom directory configuration, allowing you to specify where notes should be stored and managed:

```python
# Initialize with custom directory
agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='/path/to/my/notes')

# Initialize with relative path
agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='./project_notes')

# Initialize with default (current directory)
agent = KnowledgeAgent()
```

### Directory Structure Layout

The system creates a structured directory layout:

```
your_directory/
├── .knowledge_base/          # AI-managed knowledge data
│   ├── chroma.sqlite3        # Vector database
│   ├── graph.json           # Knowledge graph
│   ├── hash_cache.json      # Content hash cache
│   └── note_mapping.json    # Note-to-node mappings
├── ideas/                   # "Ideas to Develop" category
│   └── README.md
├── learning/                # "Learning" category
│   └── README.md
├── personal/                # "Personal" category
│   └── README.md
├── projects/                # "Projects" category
│   └── README.md
├── quick-notes/             # "Quick Notes" category
│   └── README.md
├── reading-list/            # "Reading List" category
│   └── README.md
└── research/                # "Research" category
    └── README.md
```

### Key Features

1. **Custom Directory**: Notes stored in your specified directory
2. **Automatic Creation**: Directories created if they don't exist
3. **Existing Note Processing**: Processes existing notes in the directory
4. **Isolated Knowledge Base**: Each directory has its own `.knowledge_base`
5. **Multiple Agents**: Each agent can have its own directory

## Hierarchical Architecture

### Current Implementation (Hierarchical)

```python
# Hierarchical approach - Knowledge Manager coordinates Knowledge Worker
self.knowledge_worker = ToolCallingAgent(
    model=self.model,
    tools=KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS,
    max_steps=12,
    verbosity_level=1,
    planning_interval=3,
    name="knowledge_worker",
    description="Specialized knowledge management worker...",
    provide_run_summary=True,
)

self.manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    model=self.model,
    tools=[],  # Manager focuses on coordination
    max_steps=15,
    verbosity_level=1,
    additional_authorized_imports=["json", "asyncio", "datetime", "hashlib", "typing", "collections"],
    planning_interval=4,
    name="knowledge_manager",
    description="Strategic knowledge management coordinator and complex reasoning agent"
)

# Add managed agent relationship
self.manager_agent.managed_agents = [self.knowledge_worker]
```

### Previous Implementation (Dual Agent)

```python
# Old approach - two independent agents
self.tool_agent = ToolCallingAgent(...)  # Primary
self.code_agent = CodeAgent(...)         # Secondary for complex tasks
```

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. **Specialized Knowledge Worker Agent (ToolCallingAgent)**

- **Role**: Handles all knowledge operations with specialized tools
- **Expertise**: Note creation, search, analysis, knowledge graph operations
- **Tools**: Direct access to all knowledge management tools
- **Benefits**: Optimized for knowledge-specific tasks

### 2. **Strategic Knowledge Manager Agent (CodeAgent)**

- **Role**: Coordinates the knowledge worker and provides strategic thinking
- **Expertise**: Complex reasoning, multi-step analysis, optimization planning
- **Management**: Delegates tasks to the knowledge worker appropriately
- **Benefits**: Higher-level reasoning and task coordination

### 3. **Intelligent Task Coordination**

The system uses sophisticated delegation logic:

```python
# Manager coordinates with worker
if hasattr(self.manager_agent, 'ask_managed_agent'):
    worker_prompt = f"""
Perform knowledge management operations for the following request:
{message}

Use your specialized knowledge tools to:
1. Analyze the request
2. Perform appropriate knowledge operations (search, create, update, analyze)
3. Provide detailed results with explanations
4. Suggest related operations or improvements
"""
    result = self.manager_agent.ask_managed_agent(
        agent=self.knowledge_worker,
        request=worker_prompt,
        timeout=30
    )
else:
    # Fallback to direct worker usage
    result = self.knowledge_worker.run(prompt)
```

### 4. **Robust Fallback Mechanism**

- **Primary**: Manager coordinates with worker using smolagents managed agent features
- **Fallback**: Direct worker agent usage if managed agent communication fails
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation maintains system functionality

## Usage Patterns

### Directory-Based Usage

```python
# Project-specific knowledge system
project_agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='./my_project_notes')

# Personal knowledge system
personal_agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='~/Documents/personal_notes')

# Team knowledge system
team_agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='/shared/team_knowledge')
```

### Simple Knowledge Operations

```python
# User: "Create a note about Python programming"
# 1. Manager analyzes request
# 2. Delegates to Knowledge Worker
# 3. Worker uses create_knowledge_note tool
# 4. Manager synthesizes and presents results
```

### Complex Knowledge Analysis

```python
# User: "Analyze relationships between programming languages and find patterns"
# 1. Manager breaks down complex request
# 2. Coordinates multiple Knowledge Worker operations
# 3. Worker performs searches, finds connections, analyzes patterns
# 4. Manager provides strategic insights and optimization suggestions
```

### Knowledge Graph Operations

```python
# User: "What are the connections between different AI concepts?"
# 1. Manager plans comprehensive analysis
# 2. Worker searches knowledge base and analyzes relationships
# 3. Worker uses find_related_notes and knowledge graph tools
# 4. Manager provides strategic relationship insights
```

## Benefits of Hierarchical Architecture

### 1. **Enhanced Specialization**

- **Knowledge Worker**: Optimized for knowledge operations
- **Knowledge Manager**: Optimized for coordination and strategic thinking
- **Clear Separation**: Each agent focuses on their strengths

### 2. **Improved Reliability**

- **Managed Communication**: Proper agent-to-agent communication
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: System continues working if one layer fails
- **Error Isolation**: Problems in coordination don't affect core knowledge operations

### 3. **Better Scalability**

- **Delegation Model**: Easy to add more specialized workers
- **Coordination Layer**: Manager can handle complex multi-agent scenarios
- **Strategic Planning**: Higher-level reasoning for optimization

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**

- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatic task delegation to appropriate agent
- **Comprehensive Responses**: Strategic insights combined with operational results
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Manager provides knowledge organization improvements

### 5. **Directory Flexibility**

- **Custom Locations**: Store notes wherever you want
- **Multiple Systems**: Different agents for different projects
- **Isolation**: Each directory has its own knowledge base
- **Existing Notes**: Processes existing notes in the directory

## Configuration

### Directory-Based Initialization

```python
# Custom directory with full path
agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='/Users/username/Documents/my_notes')

# Relative path from current directory
agent = KnowledgeAgent(dir='./project_notes')

# Default behavior (current directory)
agent = KnowledgeAgent()
```

### Agent Initialization

```python
# Knowledge Worker - specialized for knowledge operations
self.knowledge_worker = ToolCallingAgent(
    model=self.model,
    tools=KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS,
    max_steps=12,           # Sufficient for knowledge operations
    verbosity_level=1,
    planning_interval=3,    # Frequent planning for tool usage
    name="knowledge_worker",
    provide_run_summary=True,
)

# Knowledge Manager - strategic coordination
self.manager_agent = CodeAgent(
    model=self.model,
    tools=[],               # No direct tools - focuses on coordination
    max_steps=15,           # More steps for complex reasoning
    verbosity_level=1,
    planning_interval=4,    # Strategic planning intervals
    managed_agents=[self.knowledge_worker],  # Manages the worker
    name="knowledge_manager",
)
```

### Memory Management

```python
def reset_agent_memory(self):
    """Reset hierarchical agent system"""
    # Reset both agents with proper initialization order
    # Worker first, then manager with managed agent relationship
    self.knowledge_worker = ToolCallingAgent(...)
    self.manager_agent = CodeAgent(...)
    self.manager_agent.managed_agents = [self.knowledge_worker]
```

## Testing

   📝 Notes directory: /path/to/your/notes
   🧠 Knowledge base: /path/to/your/notes/.knowledge_base

🤖 Hierarchical Knowledge Agent System Ready!
   📚 Knowledge Worker: knowledge_worker
   🧠 Knowledge Manager: knowledge_manager

🧠 Knowledge Manager analyzing request...
🔄 Using knowledge worker directly...  # Fallback mechanism working
```

## Legacy Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility:

```python
# Legacy properties still work
@property
def tool_agent(self):
    """Legacy compatibility: return knowledge worker"""
    return self.knowledge_worker

@property
def code_agent(self):
    """Legacy compatibility: return manager agent"""
    return self.manager_agent
```
