# Knowledge Management System - smolagents Upgrade

## Overview

This document summarizes the upgrade of the Knowledge Management System from a workflow-based approach to a true AI agent powered by smolagents.

## What Changed

### 1. Architecture Transformation

- **Before**: Workflow-based system with sequential processing
- **After**: True AI agent with multi-step reasoning and tool usage

### 2. New Components

#### `agent/knowledge_tools.py`

- Custom tools for knowledge management operations
- 9 specialized tools using the `@tool` decorator:
  - `process_and_categorize_content`: Analyze and categorize content
  - `create_knowledge_note`: Create new notes
  - `update_knowledge_note`: Update existing notes
  - `search_knowledge`: Search the knowledge base
  - `find_related_notes`: Find related notes
  - `decide_note_action`: Decide whether to create or update
  - `get_all_notes`: Get all notes
  - `search_notes`: Search for specific notes
  - `get_knowledge_graph_data`: Get knowledge graph data

#### Updated `agent/knowledge_agent.py`

- Now uses smolagents `CodeAgent` instead of custom workflow
- Intelligent prompt engineering for better agent behavior
- Integration with all custom tools
- Support for multiple LLM providers (HuggingFace, OpenAI, LiteLLM)
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Enhanced API

#### New Endpoints

- `GET /agent/logs` - Get agent execution logs for debugging
- `POST /agent/reset` - Reset agent memory
- `GET /agent/info` - Get agent information and capabilities

#### Updated Endpoints

- All existing endpoints now work with the agent-based system
- Improved error handling and response parsing
- Better integration with the smolagents framework

### 4. Dependencies

- Added `smolagents[toolkit,litellm]>=1.0.0`
- Updated Python requirement to `>=3.10` (required by smolagents)

## Key Benefits

### 1. True Intelligence

- Multi-step reasoning instead of fixed workflows
- Dynamic tool selection based on context
- Adaptive behavior based on user needs

### 2. Enhanced Capabilities

- Natural language understanding of complex requests
- Intelligent decision-making for note creation/updating
- Contextual tool usage
- Self-correction and error recovery

### 3. Extensibility

- Easy to add new tools with the `@tool` decorator
- Hub integration for sharing tools
- Support for multi-agent systems
- Flexible model configuration

### 4. Better User Experience

- More natural conversational interface
- Intelligent suggestions and actions
- Real-time streaming responses
- Detailed execution logs for transparency

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from agent.knowledge_agent import KnowledgeAgent

agent = KnowledgeAgent()
await agent.initialize()

response = await agent.process_message("Create a note about machine learning")
print(response.response)
```

### Streaming Usage

```python
async for chunk in agent.stream_response("Tell me about AI"):
    print(chunk)
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Create a note
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a note about Python best practices"}'

# Get agent info
curl http://localhost:8000/agent/info
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `HF_TOKEN`: HuggingFace token for better model access
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key for GPT models
- `E2B_API_KEY`: E2B API key for secure code execution

### Model Configuration

The agent automatically selects the best available model:

1. HuggingFace models with token (if available)
2. OpenAI models via LiteLLM (if API key provided)
3. Free HuggingFace models (fallback)

## Testing

Run the integration tests:

```bash
cd backend
uv run python test_smolagents_integration.py
```

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

- The API remains backward compatible
- All existing endpoints continue to work
- New agent-specific endpoints provide additional functionality

### For Users

- Same interface with enhanced capabilities
- Better responses and suggestions
- More intelligent content processing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Support for specialized agents
2. **Custom Model Fine-tuning**: Domain-specific model training
3. **Advanced Tool Integration**: More sophisticated tools
4. **Knowledge Graph Reasoning**: Enhanced graph-based reasoning
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Multi-user agent interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Access Errors**: Set up appropriate API keys or tokens
2. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `uv sync`
3. **Tool Execution Errors**: Check logs at `/agent/logs` endpoint

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting `verbosity_level=2` in the agent configuration.

## Conclusion

The smolagents upgrade transforms the Knowledge Management System from a simple workflow processor into a truly intelligent agent capable of multi-step reasoning, dynamic tool usage, and adaptive behavior. This provides a much more powerful and flexible foundation for knowledge management tasks.
